Intsy 128 ch system pcb files.  Note this design uses Teensy 3.6, which is considered a legacy device as of 2024/25. 
At some point in the near future, it may become strictly necessary to use a Teensy 4.1 which would necessiate minor modifications to pcb design because
T4.1 and 3.6 and not pin-for-pin compatible (bummer).
Namely, the SPI port pins have moved.  Also note that the firmware would need to be correspondingly updated, namely the defintions of SPI port pin numbers.
The rest of the pcb design--and firmware--should be essentially ready to go.
