# Intsy
32/64/128 channel bioamplifier system, now with accelerometer and on-board SD data logging capability for ambulatory applications! Photos of the original 32/64 channel device are below Also, check out the quick overview of the device internals of the 128 channel ambulatory system in <a href =  "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvYDtEdVOBU&feature=youtu.be">this video</a> (big props to Riwaj Shrestha, Suyash Mathema, and Jeremy Wharton!).

Intsy is a new low-cost, open-source, wireless-enabled bioamplifier system.  The system can be configured for 32, 64, or 128 channel operation.  It has been validated for gastrointesinal slow wave recordings and surface EMG. Full details are provided in our <a href =  "http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6579/aaad51">published peer-reviewed article in Physiological Measurement</a>.

Data can be streamed either wirelessly via bluetooth or in wired configuration over USB.  A LabView interface allows for real-time visualization and saving to hard disk for off-line analysis.  Data rates of 32 chan x 110 Hz can be stably transmitted over bluetooth.  The USB wired configuration can achieve up to 2 kHz x 128 chan.  

The name Intsy comes from the two core components: Intan RHD2132 bioamplifier chip + Teensy 3.6 microcontroller.

Please see "Intsy_Setup_Guide.pdf" for detailed instructions on how to set up the Intsy system. Assembly time is typically about 2-4 hrs.  Total cost is about $1500 for the 32 channel system,  $2400 for the 64 channel system, and $4800 for the 128 channel system (the dominant cost being the Intan RHD2132 amplifier boards).  That means in just half a day you can build your very own high-quality, low-cost, portable bioamplifier system!

All feedback and suggestions are warmly welcomed.
